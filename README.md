The repository holds my solutions to the problem sets found in the book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python](https://www.statlearning.com/).
The [documentation for the ISLP package](https://intro-stat-learning.github.io/ISLP/index.html) has additional information on the data sets used.
